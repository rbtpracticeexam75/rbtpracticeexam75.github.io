        <h2>1. What information we collect</h2>
        <p class="small">We collect only the information necessary to operate the site, improve content, comply with legal obligations, and provide basic interactive features.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Automatically collected data:</strong> We collect technical data such as IP address, browser type, device type, operating system, referral URL, pages visited, and time spent on pages. This data is collected via server logs and analytics tools.</li>

          <li><strong>Form data:</strong> If you choose to contact us (via a contact form or email link), we collect the information you submit (name, email, message) to respond to you.</li>
          <li><strong>Third-party data:</strong> If you interact with third-party services embedded on our site (e.g., YouTube, Google services, affiliate links), those providers may collect data independently. We don't control their practices—see their privacy policies for details.</li>

        <p class="small">We use cookies and similar technologies to improve site functionality and measure usage. Below are common categories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Essential cookies:</strong> Required for basic site operation (e.g., session management). These cannot be turned off without affecting site function.</li>
